  <h2 class="sectionHeader">WHAT TO KNOW</h2>

  <h2>My goal is to inform people about the true nature of muslims since many people seem to overlook their goodness and
    jump straight into the bad. I want people to learn that in everything, there is bad and Islam is no exception.
    Therefore, before they begin to criticize, they should know this fact and educate themselves before.</h2>

        <p>Majority of the world think that most Muslims are Jihad terrorists. This, however is not true. Only a small
          percentage of people call themselves Muslims and go ahead and take the lives of multiple innocent people.These
          people are not Muslims, they are plain terrorists. As a Muslim, one is supposed to preserve life and take care
          of oneself and others, not to destroy and eradicate. This goes against Islam.</p>

      <div class="menu2 section">
        <p>Another thing is that, people fabricate muslims to be looked upon this way. Upon every event where there is a
          terrorist attack, muslims are always the first suspects even if they didn't commit the crime. Many of the
          terrorist attacks carried out in the united states are mainly not by muslims but rather by people who are
          crazy and want attention and vengeance. somehow, the same people who say muslims are terrorists don't
          acknowledge the terrorisms carried out on muslims. </p>

        <p>
        </p>Sometimes, people hate for no reason and blindly follow the public's opinion. This doesn't only affect the
        attacked, it affects the attackers as well because they don't become unified and they block themselves from
        realizing good from bad and terrorists from normal humans.</p>
